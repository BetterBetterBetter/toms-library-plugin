# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Courses and Series get a "Purchase options" box in place of the single
  purchase offer: up to three options, each with a name, price, price note,
  what's included (one per line), button text, optional button price and a
  checkout link: the normal sign-up page on this site for memberships, or an
  Access bundle checkout (`https://access.tomwoods.com/checkout/bundle/…`) for
  bundles. Raw Stripe and third-party links are rejected. Options can be
  reordered; the first one is the Library's main buy button. Each saved
  option shows whether it is live in the Library or what it still needs, and
  what the link sells: the MemberPress membership and price, or what Access
  will charge for the bundle (from Access's public bundle details). An existing single offer is carried into the first option the next
  time the item is edited.
- Catalogue schema `20261026.1` adds `purchase_options` (complete options
  only). `purchase_offer` is kept for older Library releases and mirrors the
  first option. Fixed the Login as User switch-back link that WordPress
  rejected as expired.

## 0.13.0 - 2026-09-03

- Fixed the Access Groups review wrongly blocking publication on sites where
  legacy courses are protected by LearnDash enrolment rather than MemberPress
  rules (Liberty Classroom: 0 of 1,266 items had a MemberPress rule, so the
  review treated everything as open and counted about two million phantom
  losses). When no MemberPress rule protects an item, today's access is now
  read from LearnDash enrolment for its legacy course; open and free courses
  count as open to everyone.
- A blocked review now says who would lose access and why: the number of
  people, grouped by the memberships they hold (or "No active membership"),
  with sample usernames, instead of a raw combination count.
- Publish is one step. It runs the member-by-member check and publishes
  immediately when nobody loses access; otherwise nothing changes and the
  blocked explanation is shown. "Preview the check first" remains as a
  secondary action.

## 0.12.0 - 2026-09-03

- Put the Library menu in one deliberate order regardless of which module
  registers each item: Dashboard, Courses, Series, Content, Speakers,
  Collections, Topics, Homepage, Announcements, Access Groups, Settings,
  Migration.
- Turned the Dashboard into a status hub. One card per subsystem, each with
  the same shape: a state badge (Live, Draft, Review, Needs attention, Not set
  up), the one number that matters, and where to go. Cards cover the catalogue
  (drafts waiting to publish), Access Groups (live vs draft, review waiting),
  the Library app connection (sign-in readiness and catalogue sync, read
  locally so the page stays fast), the homepage layout, and migration state.
  Below them: recently edited Library items with a Live/Draft chip, and the
  create actions.
- Shared status chips (`tsol-status-chip`) so every page uses the same five
  states and colours.
- Plainer page titles: "Homepage" and "Migration".

## 0.11.0 - 2026-09-03

- Redesigned the Access Groups page around two panels, Live and Draft. Live
  shows what members have now and when it was published; Draft lists exactly
  what would change (groups added, changed with the scopes they gain or lose,
  removed, and which memberships gain or lose which groups) with one action
  for its state: Review changes, then Publish or Back to editing.
- Every group card carries a Live / Changed / New badge, and the membership
  editor shows "Draft differs from live" with the specific groups involved.
- Publishing uses a normal confirmation dialog instead of typing
  `publish-access-groups`. The safety net is unchanged and server-side: a
  publish that would remove access from any current member stays blocked.
- The plugin now records a published snapshot of groups and assignments when
  a publish succeeds (and backfills it for installs that were already live),
  which is what makes the draft comparison exact.
- Replaced implementation jargon ("stage", "checked changes", "pending") with
  Live, Draft, Review, Publish, and Undo throughout the page.

## 0.10.2 - 2026-09-03

- Added a write-only "Session revocation secret" field to Library →
  Authentication for hosts where wp-config cannot be edited. A server-defined
  `TSOL_LIBRARY_AUTH_REVOCATION_SECRET` constant still wins and disables the
  field; the saved value is never displayed, must be at least 32 characters,
  and must differ from the client and catalogue secrets. Until one of the two
  is present WordPress cannot end Library sessions on password change, account
  deletion, or role change.

## 0.10.1 - 2026-09-03

- Cut the catalogue snapshot endpoint from about 536 to 87 database queries
  per 100-record page by priming post, meta, term, parent, speaker, and
  thumbnail caches for the page up front, reading terms through the object
  term cache, and resolving each Speaker once per request. Output is
  byte-identical to before (verified against a full 1,266-record dump), so
  no content fingerprints change. On the Liberty Classroom production server a
  page went from over 5 s, past the app's timeout, to roughly 1 s.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-09-03

- The catalogue import now runs in resumable steps from the Migration page
  instead of one long request: a rollback snapshot is saved before anything is
  written, then records, relationships, and the homepage/Access Groups finish
  in batches of 100 with a live progress bar and a timestamped log. Each step
  is its own short request, so production timeouts and memory limits no
  longer cut an import in half.
- Records whose fingerprint already matches production are skipped instead of
  rewritten. A repeat import of an unchanged catalogue writes nothing.
- If a step fails, the page shows the error, keeps the log, and offers Resume;
  closing the tab does the same. The rollback snapshot taken before the first
  write stays available, so a partial import can always be undone exactly.
- The log and progress persist with the pending import for 24 hours.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-09-03

- Fixed the staged migration import stopping with "applyForm.submit is not a
  function" after the files were prepared. The Import, Export, and Rollback
  buttons were rendered with `name="submit"`, which shadows the form's
  `submit()` method in the browser. The buttons now carry distinct names and
  the page submits through `HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit`. A contract
  assertion renders the page and rejects any control named "submit".

## 0.9.0 - 2026-09-03

- Link uploads that WP Offload Media already keeps in the shared storage
  bucket instead of shipping their bytes: the exporter records each public
  offloaded object (provider, region, bucket, key, URL) and leaves the file out
  of the ZIP; the production preview verifies the object with a HEAD request
  and reports it as "Linked from storage"; the resumable import registers a
  WordPress attachment plus its WP Offload Media record at that same key.
  Rolling back a linked attachment deletes only the WordPress record, never
  the shared object. Sites without WP Offload Media keep bundling every
  non-video upload exactly as before.
- Stopped hashing multi-gigabyte videos the exporter never bundles; their size
  is still verified on production. The Liberty Classroom export dropped from
  about two minutes to under a second.
- Speakers no longer export a legacy MemberPress authorization source, and a
  Speaker authorization carried by an older package is ignored. Their legacy
  source IDs are importer bookkeeping that collided with unrelated posts and
  made every Liberty Classroom import fail at the Access Groups step.
- Access Groups no longer fail closed when the site has no Masterclasses
  collection; Entire Library expands to every Course individually on such
  brands. The collection scope itself still appears only when the term exists.
- The import preview now reports bundled, linked, and matched upload counts
  separately, and the resumable file stage covers both bundled and linked
  uploads.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-09-02

- Kept WordPress-hosted video files out of Library migration ZIPs when the
  destination WordPress site already owns the matching attachment, avoiding
  redundant multi-gigabyte uploads for media managed by the site or S3.
- Added explicit production attachment matching for referenced videos and
  block the import preview until every referenced video is present.
- Enforced the migration package size and entry limits during export so the
  exporter can no longer create a ZIP that its importer will reject.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-09-02

- Added portable Course and Series purchase-offer fields for display price,
  sales or checkout URL, and editable buy-button text.
- Added the normalized `purchase_offer` catalogue field in schema
  `20260902.1`; non-parent records and incomplete offers emit `null`.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-09-02

- Replaced the standalone authentication fallback with a plain, logo-free 403
  page. It does not read brand names, artwork, colors, or app configuration.
- Routed member-facing application references through
  `MemberLibrary_Brand::app_name()` and removed the remaining visible "TSOL
  view" wording.
- Removed nine unreferenced TSOL content images from the shared release and
  cleaned stale TSOL-only source comments.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-01

De-branded the plugin core. The plugin no longer names a specific project
anywhere a person can see it, and it no longer needs `wp-config` to be neutral.

- **Brand defaults are now universal.** They previously fell back to the TSOL
  values, so a neutral install was the thing that required configuration —
  backwards. Now: menu label `Library` (was `TSOL Library`), brand name
  `Member Library` (was `The Tom Woods School of Life`), and **no logo** (was a
  hardcoded tomschooloflife.com SVG), with the interstitial CSP falling back to
  `'self'`. The constant/option override chain survives only as opt-in
  decoration for a brand that wants its own wording.
- Replaced 29 TSOL-branded display strings and 37 "School" references across
  21 files with universal wording — "Return to the site", "Sign-in is
  temporarily unavailable", "Library app cursor", "Access Groups — …".
- Added `MemberLibrary_Brand::app_name()` for admin copy that refers to the
  member-facing application.
- The brand-config contract now fails if any brand default ever names a
  specific project again.

**Machine identifiers are unchanged** and remain the frozen cross-brand
contract: REST namespace `tsol-library/v1`, the `X-TSOL-*` webhook/catalogue/
transcript headers, `X-TSOL-Client-ID`, `tsol_*` options/hooks/meta, the
`tsol_library_*` CPTs, the catalogue outbox table, and the `tsol-library`
OAuth client id.

**Note for existing installs:** an install that configures nothing now shows
`Library` instead of `TSOL Library`. A brand that wants its previous wording
sets `tsol_library_brand_library_menu_label` (option) or the matching constant.
Generated MemberPress rule titles change from `TSOL Access Groups — …` to
`Access Groups — …` for NEWLY generated rules only; existing rows keep their
titles.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-01

Consolidation into one canonical multi-brand library plugin (serves Tom's
School of Life and Liberty Classroom via per-install brand config).

- Reconciled the Liberty fork's improvements into the core: collection
  appearance colors with WCAG contrast enforcement, catalogue schema
  `20260830.1` + media `duration_seconds`, native authorization through the
  parent Course/Series, an explicit `tsol_library_header` nav location, and
  environment-migration package schema v2 (reads v1).
- Added `MemberLibrary_Brand` per-install brand configuration (constant →
  option → default); replaced hardcoded brand couplings (auth interstitial
  logo/CSP, OAuth client-id default, admin labels). Fixes the fork bug where
  the auth error page served the wrong logo/CSP regardless of brand.
- Stripped the plugin to the library core only: removed the accountability
  modal, cookie consent, and TSOL legacy data migrations (they belong in the
  separate TSOL companion plugin); kept the active Liberty LearnDash importer.
- Renamed internal PHP identifiers `TSOL_* → MemberLibrary_*`, the main class
  to `Member_Library_Plugin`, internal constants to `MEMBER_LIBRARY_PLUGIN_*`,
  the text domain to `member-library`, and the entry file to
  `member-library-plugin.php`. **Machine identifiers** (REST namespace
  `tsol-library/v1`, `tsol_*` hooks/options/meta/CPTs/table, `X-TSOL-*`
  headers, `TSOL_LIBRARY_*` wp-config constants) are unchanged — a frozen
  cross-brand contract.
- Rewired the update channel to the canonical repo; added CI (PHP lint) and a
  tagged release ZIP workflow; `RELEASE.md` supersedes `UPDATER_GUIDE.md`.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-08-27

- Moved the WebVTT transcript upload and synchronization status into the Content editor’s Media panel, directly beneath the primary playback source.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-27

- Added a private WebVTT upload panel to every Library Content editor, with replacement status and validation for UTF-8 `.vtt` files up to 5 MB.
- Delivers transcript replacements to the School app through an exact content/video identity match, dedicated signed headers, bounded retries, and fail-closed request validation.
- Includes WordPress-owned transcript sources in WordPress-only Library migration packages while keeping transcripts out of the public catalogue payload.

## 0.4.6 - 2026-08-27

- Replaced the long synchronous attachment import with resumable two-file requests and visible progress, then applies catalogue records only after every bundled file passes its checksum.
- Reuses the existing verified ZIP and preview for up to 24 hours, so interrupted production imports resume without another 378.5 MB upload.
- Avoids expensive image-size generation during migration; the School catalogue can use the verified original WordPress media URLs immediately.

## 0.4.5 - 2026-08-27

- Automatically recovers Library migration locks left behind for more than one hour by an interrupted PHP request, while retaining exclusive locking for active imports.

## 0.4.4 - 2026-08-27

- Preserved portable MemberPress authorization for Library lessons and Series items by following their Course or Series authority to its legacy WordPress source.
- Added backward-compatible recovery for ZIP packages exported before 0.4.4, allowing the existing production package to repair missing child catalogue records without another export.
- Reapplying the verified ZIP now relinks its bundled featured images, Speaker headshots, and other WordPress attachment references while retaining the existing rollback boundary.

## 0.4.3 - 2026-08-27

- Fixed full catalogue snapshot pagination when legacy posts share Library post types but cannot be exported, ensuring every continuation cursor identifies the final emitted record and preventing `INVALID_SNAPSHOT_CURSOR` failures in the School worker.

## 0.4.2 - 2026-08-26

- Added a write-only WordPress fallback for the dedicated catalogue synchronization secret when production hosting cannot provide `TSOL_LIBRARY_CATALOGUE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; server-managed constants still take precedence.
- Added an administrator-only, nonce-protected **Retry synchronization now** action that immediately retries the retained catalogue cursor without recreating or discarding catalogue data.
- Expanded synchronization guidance and status notices so configuration mismatches can be corrected without re-importing the catalogue.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-26

- Replaced the reference-only migration download with one self-contained ZIP containing the WordPress Library catalogue, portable Access Groups, and every referenced WordPress upload.
- Added checksum and size verification for every bundled file, safe archive-path enforcement, exact attachment conflict reporting, Media Library registration, image metadata generation, and attachment/file rollback.
- Added 512 KB browser chunk uploads so complete Library packages work even when production PHP and reverse-proxy upload limits are much smaller than the package.
- Expanded the import preview to report bundled and existing files separately and list any genuinely missing paths instead of presenting an unactionable aggregate warning.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-26

- Added **TSOL Library → Migration** for checksum-verified, preview-first movement of WordPress-owned Library records, taxonomy, homepage curation, attachment references, Access Groups, and membership assignments between test and production.
- Explicitly excluded the standalone app database, app accounts, sessions, progress, notes, bookmarks, WordPress users, MemberPress transactions, secrets, logs, generated rules, and temporary state from migration packages.
- Added stable UUID and membership-slug mapping, guarded adoption of matching records created by older independent imports, blocking identity and authorization conflicts, missing-attachment warnings, exact confirmation phrases, operation locking, and one-step rollback.
- Imported Access Groups as an unpublished draft and retained the existing MemberPress rules as the live comparison baseline; publication remains blocked whenever the full current-user/content matrix would remove access.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-08-26

- Allowed production sites without source or host configuration access to save the Library bridge client secret through the existing write-only WordPress setting, while continuing to prefer and protect a server-managed `TSOL_LIBRARY_CLIENT_SECRET` constant when available.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-26

- Added **TSOL Library → Access Groups**, where administrators create named reusable Library access packages and define the Courses, Series, collections, or broad Library areas each package unlocks.
- Added a **Library Access Groups** panel to MemberPress membership editors so new and existing products can receive one or more packages without duplicating access conditions.
- Added guarded compilation to native MemberPress rules, full current-user/content access comparison, explicit publication confirmation, concurrent-operation locking, source-change detection, and one-step rollback.
- Imported the complete current policy—including the separately shipped New Marketer Workshop rule—into eight editable groups while preserving the non-membership exception.
- Made Access Groups the ownership boundary for TSOL Library rules: plugin-owned stragglers can be reconciled without changing live access, arbitrary rules are never auto-modified, and publishing is blocked while any Library rule remains unmanaged.
- Retired the completed Import & Legacy browser tab while preserving its guarded WP-CLI verification and rollback tools, and updated Library Settings to direct administrators to Access Groups instead of raw MemberPress rules.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-08-26

- Updated the guarded Library normalization, catalogue, publication, and MemberPress access manifests for the latest production snapshot, including Medicine Cabinet Sessions 3 and 4 and the production Social Media course slug.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-08-26

- Made MemberPress migration verification identify approved Course-root access corrections by stable WordPress slug instead of mutable titles.
- Added a MemberPress Account Security tab with an explicitly confirmed, nonce-protected action that queues durable all-device Library session revocation without implying that WordPress, MemberPress, or Access sessions are also cleared.
- Made the native Course body the single public **About this course** source, retained ordered learning outcomes as structured fields, and removed the duplicate Course WYSIWYG.
- Added a strict semantic HTML boundary for every Library and Speaker WYSIWYG synchronized to the standalone application, stripping pasted styling, layout wrappers, embeds, scripts, and unsafe links on save and export.
- Added a guarded Course-body publication migration that privately archives legacy resource-only bodies, moves their downloads and links into protected lesson Resources, and retires duplicate public-description metadata.
- Added durable, HMAC-signed catalogue wake-ups with request coalescing, bounded retries, and the existing incremental journal as a polling fallback; no catalogue or MemberPress data is sent in the webhook.
- Replaced the Speaker headshot attachment-editor workaround with WordPress's native select-then-crop media workflow, requiring an interactive 1:1 crop while retaining the original upload.
- Removed the redundant editable Library inclusion checkbox: the dedicated Course, Series, and Content post types now establish Library identity automatically, while WordPress status controls member visibility and non-published records remain available for administrator preview in the protected projection.
- Replaced the plain Speaker multiple select on Library editors with a searchable visual profile picker, ordered selected cards, keyboard controls, responsive presentation, and a native no-JavaScript fallback.
- Replaced the retired Library Speakers taxonomy with private Speaker profiles using the classic About editor, native Featured Image headshots, role/organisation/website/social fields, and direct Course/Series/Content relationships that never participate in MemberPress authorization.
- Moved Gemini configuration from the generic TSOL settings screen into a dedicated Accountability Modal AI Matching tab without changing the stored credential or option names.
- Consolidated the AI enable switch, model, fit threshold, fallback explanation, and privacy notice under the feature that uses them.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-09

- Added a dedicated TSOL Library Footer menu location and authenticated navigation endpoint for the standalone Library.
- Return an empty navigation list when no menu is assigned so the Library can omit the WordPress-managed menu cleanly.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-07

- Added the TSOL Library authentication bridge with mandatory S256 PKCE, exact callbacks, hashed one-use authorization codes, short-lived tokens, rate limits, and signed logout propagation.
- Separated authentication from course authorization: every authenticated WordPress user can enter the Library, while MemberPress-native per-content rules and WordPress `manage_options` decide protected content access without a second allowlist.
- Added authenticated content-access and readiness endpoints, redacted audit events, no-store security headers, `DONOTCACHEPAGE` and WP Rocket exclusions, and scheduled authorization-code cleanup.
- Made Access Platform SSO an optional WordPress login source instead of a hard plugin dependency.
- Required production bridge secrets to be supplied outside the WordPress database.
- Made Consent Mode defaults cache-safe by always denying optional storage until the visitor's saved choice is applied in the browser.
- Enforced consent expiry in both the cookie and localStorage fallback and applied Global Privacy Control to previously stored marketing consent.
- Removed known first-party analytics and marketing cookies on rejection, then reloaded after withdrawal so already-running consent-managed trackers stop.
- Routed the official Tapfiliate plugin's loader and WooCommerce conversion payload through the Marketing consent category.
- Converted the site's WPCode MemberPress and WooCommerce Tapfiliate handlers into inert Marketing-category scripts until consent is granted.
- Added a compatibility bridge that makes legacy HFCM Google, Vimeo Player API, RocketChat, and Kissmetrics snippets consent-controlled while they are being retired from configuration.
- Gated server-rendered Vimeo/YouTube iframes and Elementor video-lightbox launches behind Marketing consent with a visible settings placeholder.
- Added accessible JavaScript syntax validation to the consent snippet editor so malformed tracker snippets cannot be saved from the admin screen.
- Preserved JavaScript backslashes when saving cookie-consent snippets by removing redundant Settings API unslashing.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-06-17

- Fixed the cookie preferences modal so Reject optional closes the blocking overlay after saving consent.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-06-15

- Iterated the release version for the AI-assisted accountability group matching release.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-06-15

- Added AI-assisted accountability group recommendations using Gemini structured JSON output.
- Added availability-filtered top-three recommendations, Show all groups fallback, and one-click group joining through the Groups API.
- Added soft dependency gating for the accountability enrollment engine to avoid unsynced half-joins.
- Added admin controls for AI matching, Gemini model selection, fit threshold, and per-group matching bio overrides.
- Added joined/requested group metadata to accountability submissions.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-06-12

- Improved Cookie Consent script management with repeater-style URL fields.
- Added accordion-based inline JavaScript snippets with editable saved snippet names.
- Added WordPress code editor support for inline JavaScript snippets.
- Improved script admin UI polish, spacing, focus states, icon-only remove buttons, and single-item remove handling.
- Preserved named empty snippets in the admin while keeping empty JavaScript out of the frontend payload.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-06-12

- Added shared launcher docking so floating TSOL buttons in the same corner stack instead of overlapping.
- Changed the cookie consent floating button to use a cookie icon instead of the site logo.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-06-12

- Added modular Cookie Consent feature with a TSOL admin submenu.
- Added branded frontend cookie banner, preference center, and floating settings button.
- Added Google Consent Mode v2 defaults and consent updates for analytics/marketing choices.
- Added consent-controlled analytics and marketing script loading buckets.
- Added configurable banner copy, legal links, category descriptions, display placement, GPC handling, and consent versioning.
- Added admin implementation notes for migrating hard-coded tracking snippets into consent-aware loading.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-06-11

- Added GitHub Plugin Update Checker support for WordPress dashboard updates.
- Added release documentation for version bumps and GitHub release assets.
- Added configurable resume launcher placement in the accountability modal display rules.
- Added resume launcher progress bubble for users who have completed more than one step.
- Added nonce-protected admin deletion for saved accountability submissions.
- Improved launcher eligibility so submitted users and existing accountability group members do not see the modal launcher.
- Improved launcher icon centering and switched it to the uploaded site icon as a white mask.
- Improved modal accessibility with progressbar labeling, focus handling, and contrast fixes.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-11

- Initial site-specific plugin scaffold.
- Added dependency checks for Access Platform SSO.
- Added modular accountability modal feature.
- Added TSOL admin menu with overview, submissions, display rules, and content tabs.
- Added configurable modal questions, page display rules, local draft saving, admin preview, and CSV submission export.
